# React Admin Console for SaaS scenarios

Here is an administration console that I've put together that uses Azure Active Directory as its directory service.

## Installation

1. Clone this GitHub repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harishnarain/hcloud-admin
```
2. Install all dependent npm packages
```bash
npm install --save
```
3. Run the demo in development
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Update the clientId section of the /src/authConfig.js file to include your specific application ID from your Azure AD application registration.
